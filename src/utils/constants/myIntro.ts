        Software Engineer.
        I'm a new MCS student at the University of California, Irvine.
        Previously, I was an undergrad majoring in Computer Information Science, minoring in Statistics and Psychology at the Ohio State University.
        I have internship experiences at The Trade Desk and Piesat Information Technology co. ltd, developing Web & mobile app on both frond-end and back-end.
        I'm always enthusiastic about exploring new areas and I do enjoy solving problems. I'm looking for opportunities to apply my knowledge and learn new skills.
